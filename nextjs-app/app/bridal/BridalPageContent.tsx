Too many voices can make the decision harder, while a small, supportive group helps you focus on what feels right for you. If you anticipate having 5 or more people for your bridal appointment, we offer a VIP appointment with a fee for your convenience."

If you do not purchase your dress within the 24-hour period, the $50 will be retained and the dress will be returned to the floor.
