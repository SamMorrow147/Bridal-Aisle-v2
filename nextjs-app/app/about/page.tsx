          <h2>A legacy of love & dedication</h2>
            <p>
              Founded by Annette and Brad in 2013, Bridal Aisle began with a simple idea: brides 
              deserve stunning designer gowns without the designer price tag. What started as a small, 
              heartfelt endeavor has grown into a trusted name across the Midwest.
            </p>
            <p>
              With a background in fashion merchandising and a passion for exceptional service, Annette 
              shaped the foundation of the boutique on expertise, value, and genuine connection. Today, 
              Bridal Aisle continues to help couples find their perfect look—their way.
            </p>
            <p>
              From one intimate storefront to a spacious, sought-after boutique, Bridal Aisle has grown 
              alongside the couples we serve. In 2020, we expanded with Budget Bridal Outlet by BA, 
              offering gowns priced at $800 and under to ensure every bride can find something beautiful 
              within reach.
            </p>
            <p>
              Home to Bridal Aisle Boutique and Budget Bridal Outlet, and now The Woods offering suits for purchase and rentals for wedding parties, we remain committed to making every &ldquo;yes&rdquo; joyful, authentic, and stress-free.

          Is there a way I can add more than 5 stars? Because this place deserves it!! Not only are the owners and employees extremely friendly and helpful, but they also listened to what my vision was and then made it come to life significantly under my budget. I loved that they let me look around first to show them what I wanted. Found the dress of my dreams for only $800, and took it home that same day, and I will recommend this place to everyone looking for formal attire.&quot;

        {
          question: "Do I need to set up an appointment to try on wedding dresses?",
          answer: "Yes. We require all brides to book appointments. Don't hesitate to make your appointment as we book up well in advance. Appointments allow us to provide you and your party with the attention and experience you deserve."
        },
        {
          question: "Why do you charge for bridal appointments?",
          answer: "Our appointment fee ensures that we can provide you with dedicated, personalized service and maintain our curated collection of designer gowns. This fee helps us offer you the exclusive, stress-free experience that makes Bridal Aisle special. Our bridal gown appointments are 90 minutes for brides who are ready to take their dream dress home!"
        },
        {
          question: "How many people should I bring with me to try on wedding dresses?",
          answer: "We welcome parties of up to 4 plus the Bride. We recommend bringing 2-4 people whose opinions you trust. Too many voices can make the decision harder, while a small, supportive group helps you focus on what feels right for you. If you anticipate having 5 or more people for your bridal appointment, we offer a VIP appointment with a fee for your convenience."

        {
          question: "I want to find accessories for a wedding dress I already have. Am I allowed to bring it into the shop?",
          answer: "Absolutely! We find it's much easier to help you find the right additions to your gown when you can try them on together. Please call to get on our schedule or book online here."
        },
        {
          question: "What is your return/exchange policy?",

        },
        {
          question: "Can you hold a dress for me while I think it over?",
          answer: "We can hold your dresses for 24 hours for a non-refundable $50. The $50 will be applied to the purchase of your dress. If you do not purchase your dress within the 24-hour period, the $50 will be retained and the dress will be returned to the floor. This ensures we give every bride the best opportunity to find the dress of her dreams!"
        },
        {
          question: "What sizes do you carry?",
          answer: "We carry a wide range of sizes to accommodate every bride. Our collection includes sizes from 0-30+, and we're committed to helping every bride find her perfect dress."
