This fee helps us offer you the exclusive, stress-free experience that makes Bridal Aisle special. Our bridal gown appointments are 90 minutes for brides who are ready to take their dream dress home!"

            answer: "We welcome parties of up to 4 plus the Bride. We recommend bringing 2-4 people whose opinions you trust. Too many voices can make the decision harder, while a small, supportive group helps you focus on what feels right for you. If you anticipate having 5 or more people for your bridal appointment, we offer a VIP appointment with a fee for your convenience."

If you do not purchase your dress within the 24-hour period, the $50 will be retained and the dress will be returned to the floor. This ensures we give every bride the best opportunity to find the dress of her dreams!"
